This is a long-running IOT & Analytics organization that wants to drive digitization of operations in remote areas using Internet of things (IOT).
The Internet of things(IOT) describes how physical devices that are embedded with sensors,
processing ability, software, and other technologies connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.
This platform developed is called “BIGLooks”, will have a user login (Auth) to the platform. 
The user can buy utility tokens. Each user has a dashboard that displays information about their transaction.
